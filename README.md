Zero Carbon

Zero Carbon is an innovative marketplace that revolutionizes the trading of Carbon Credit NFTs generated by landowners. Our platform provides a secure and efficient way for landowners to sell their Carbon Credit NFTs while enabling buyers to contribute to a greener future.
How it Works

The project revolves around three main smart contracts:

    Carbon Credit NFT Contract: This contract represents the Carbon Credit NFTs generated by landowners. Landowners can mint these NFTs to certify their carbon credits. The NFTs can then be listed on the Zero Carbon Exchange for potential buyers.

    Zero Carbon Exchange: This smart contract serves as the marketplace for Carbon Credit NFTs. Buyers can browse and purchase NFTs listed on the exchange, contributing to carbon offsetting efforts and promoting sustainability.

    Carbon Units Contract: This contract represents the carbon units owned by the company. When a Carbon Credit NFT is transferred to the Carbon Units contract, the corresponding carbon units are minted as ERC20 tokens. These tokens can be traded and utilized within the ecosystem.
